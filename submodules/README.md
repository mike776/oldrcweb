# Windows is literally retarded

Since windows doesn't have proper support for symlinks I had to just copy the important files over to the right directories, this file servers as a way of accounting for where those files are and when there is an update please update those locations.


```bash
cp -r submodules/hugo-fresh site/rainbowcrow.com/themes/hugo-fresh
```
