We created the digital signage used by the Path network of trains. These signs are highly configurable by the operators including the ability to set override messages. The signs keep track of all incoming trains to the platform by interfacing with the existing ATS system. We set up a high availability cluster to make sure there is no down time on the system - even if machines go down.
