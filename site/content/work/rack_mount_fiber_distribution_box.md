The Fiber Distribution Box (**FBD**) is designed to combine up to four one inch conduits into the box before entering the cabinet.
Using the **FDB** gives you ability to utilize one HUB entry of the cabinet for four different projects (runs) of fiber.
The shared path of the fiber is the distance between the box and the HUB.
The short shared path will prevent the fiber from damaging when the next run occurs.
The **FDB** can be mounted on the top (all four sites, on the top or right next to it using Bracket 1) of the cabinet or the side using Bracket 2 (all four sites), if there is no physical space.
