The Fujitsu Photonic Shelf mounted with the original 23" brackets places the device 6" from the front of the frame. This creates a problem when trying to close the door of the cabinet. The Z shape bracket we designed will recede the Fujitsu Photonic Shelf into the frame. Only the cover plate will be visible from the front of the frame.
