Most routers and network switches are designed for a 19” 4-pole rack. The Rittal cabinet in which these switches will be mounted is a 23” 2-pole frame. This mounting bracket is designed to provide support and stability for the mounted equipment.

Two sets of mounting hardware are provided to allow for a flush or 2" offset configuration.
