The HUB will be permanently installed on the top of the cabinet.
For better protection of electrical and / or optical cables a plastic liner is inserted into the bore of the hub. â€‹ In addition, in order to achieve better grounding of the HUB to the frame ground of the cabinet, a lock nut will be used inside of the cabinet
